# Overview

This is a simple and straight forward implementation of **Quantum Discrete Cosine Transform** (QDCT) for compressing images. The goal of this QDCT implementation to show that quantum version of **Discrete Cosine Transform** (DCT) can perform much better or on-par with classical **Discrete Cosine Transform**. This implementation is using **IBM Qiskit** backend especially **Statevector** and **Aer** simulator to simulate the compression and decompression of the image.
