# Overview
----
This is a simple and straight forward implementation of **Quantum Discrete Cosine Transform** (QDCT) for compressing images. The goal of this QDCT implementation to show that quantum version of **Discrete Cosine Transform** (DCT) can perform much better or on-par with classical **Discrete Cosine Transform**
